# 6-DOF-Robot-Arm-
6 DOF Robot Arm Controlled by Joysticks and 6 Stepper Motors.

A Simple Functional Robotic Arm Design.
Nema 17 Stepper Motors were used with DVR8825 Stepper Motor Drivers.

I use the Arduino Uno board to control the motors thus there are some limitations because of the pins limitations, for example one arduino for every joint.
I will soon upload the schematic for arduino Mega which can control up to 4 stepper motors and 2 joysticks.
